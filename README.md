Since we made the visualizations separately and know we will be creating the webpage afterwards, we didnâ€™t combine the notebooks. Therefore, there are threel files in here, including one we did from the previous part.

The Interactive.ipynb file is the one to see that interactive route map. It is the only code not in the folder.

The two folders have source code for visualizations used in the final page, and those "not very successful" attempts.

Thanks for visiting this page!
